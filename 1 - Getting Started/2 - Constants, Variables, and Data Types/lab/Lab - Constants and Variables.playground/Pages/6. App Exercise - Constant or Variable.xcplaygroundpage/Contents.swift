 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let Name = "Lisa"
var Age = 20
var NumbersOfSteps = 500
var GoalsOfSteps = 2000
var AverageHeartRate = 150


print(Name)
print(Age)
print(NumbersOfSteps, GoalsOfSteps)
print(AverageHeartRate)

// Aside from the user's name, the other factors are changable, so I put "var" in front of them.
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
